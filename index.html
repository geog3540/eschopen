              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map of Illinois shows the number of acres of farm land compared to the total acre of each county in 2018. Note that the black colored counties are null values. Most of Illinois is less than 17% of farmland but areas with the highest percentage are seen in the central west and bottom east area. The lack of farmland on the upper east side is most likely due to Chicago and its suburbs being located in that area. Not to mention, the effects of Chicago’s suburban sprawl which turns rural areas that once had lots of farmland into residential areas. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This is a bivariate map of Iowa counties showing the crop yields in 2019 and 2020. On the map, the center of Iowa has a big cluster of pink tone values. These values represents a larger crop yield in 2019 compared to 2020. This is most likely due to the derecho storm that hit in August of 2019 that wiped out numerus fields with its strong winds. The pink areas are located where the storm was the most severe in Iowa further proving the correlation. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This is a graduated symbol map of people age 20-24 years in each state of the Midwest in 2018. The east states ( Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana) has the most people of this age group compared to the rest of the Midwest. Also, the more west a state is the lower the amount of people in this age group is present. The significant amount of 20-24 years olds in eastern states could be a result of those states having very big colleges. Another reason, for Illinois specifically, could be because of Chicago since large cities tend to attract this age group.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text"> This choropleth map includes the counties that when redlined back in the 1940s were given the grade of “D” which stated that the area was  “hazardous”. This map shows that black residents in these areas are still affected by the redlining today. This is communicated by using the variables: race, education, government benefit and income to show a correlation. All the data used in this map is from 2019. Most of the areas that have a high percentage of black people also have a high percentage of people on government benefits and people under the poverty line but a low percentage have a high school diploma. Yet, for areas with very few percentages of black people the opposite occurs and this is most likely due to gentrification.    </p>

              <p class="card-text">This is a choropleth map taken from my final project which I worked on with a partner. This shows a net loss of money for crops between the years 2019 and 2020. We made multiple visualizations showing the damaging effects of the Derecho that hit Iowa last August had on crops. Some of the visualizations include bivariate maps, choropleth maps, and charts. The link will bring you to our observable page which will have more information on the subject. </p>
